offer.","startTime":"04:37","endTime":"04:41","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we are increasing this To I believe 5k our next launch is the plan.","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:49","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's 5k for three months.","startTime":"04:50","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So divide that by three was whatever.","startTime":"04:52","endTime":"04:54","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But typically again we take payment up front.","startTime":"04:54","endTime":"04:56","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right now we're at 3, 600 for this three months.","startTime":"04:57","endTime":"05:00","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's only 1200amonth.","startTime":"05:00","endTime":"05:02","speaker_name":"Bill

to?","startTime":"15:41","endTime":"15:43","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What can I focus on?","startTime":"15:44","endTime":"15:46","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that continues to give value beyond the initial three months.","startTime":"15:46","endTime":"15:53","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we do have like a way to give continued value to these people.","startTime":"15:53","endTime":"15:58","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The new thing we're trying is in addition to that we are also creating a program for our ideal avatar which is somebody who's earning a fuck ton of money already.","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:10","speaker_name":"Rex

their business and they feel trapped.","startTime":"16:14","endTime":"16:17","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we come in, we identify the constraint, we support them in

yeah.","startTime":"36:28","endTime":"36:30","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's interesting, though.","startTime":"36:31","endTime":"36:32","speaker_name":"David

decisions.","startTime":"37:54","endTime":"38:04","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's like the core arbitrage that

see if I can show you guys.","startTime":"39:12","endTime":"39:19","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because the power of the quiz is not just the fact that you get the data, it's the fact that like you're able to.","startTime":"39:19","endTime":"39:31","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like.","startTime":"39:36","endTime":"39:37","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because when I like launched this quiz actually didn't know like if anyone would take it.","startTime":"39:37","endTime":"39:43","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And after I did I like chuckle because I was like if you take it now means that

doing.","startTime":"40:27","endTime":"40:32","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because as much as I like working with people like Ori I they're just not in a position to get the

think what you explain Commit Action does.","startTime":"40:53","endTime":"41:03","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's a tool like Join Premium or VIP to get our like weekly accountability bot or like weekly accountability and like people are like anti bots.","startTime":"41:03","endTime":"41:16","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like maybe not bought.","startTime":"41:16","endTime":"41:18","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"41:18","endTime":"41:18","speaker_name":"David

would pay 97 for this.","startTime":"41:30","endTime":"41:37","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like I said it because like I've told you Bill, like I think school is so early.","startTime":"41:37","endTime":"41:45","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"41:45","endTime":"41:46","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like we have 2 to 3 billion more people coming.","startTime":"41:46","endTime":"41:49","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Coming on
