not.","startTime":"10:20","endTime":"10:28","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, we know that we can reach out to people consistently over time and get them on discovery calls

that.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:02","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So at least from my perspective, Bill, does that sound pretty aligned to

Iya","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, totally.","startTime":"11:32","endTime":"11:33","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So the leverage part is like, we don't have.","startTime":"11:33","endTime":"11:35","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We've been top 30 before.","startTime":"11:39","endTime":"11:40","speaker_name":"Rex

the effort in.","startTime":"11:42","endTime":"11:45","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We didn't have a system of doing it in a way such that the ROI for Our time made sense.","startTime":"11:45","endTime":"11:51","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Actually the highest leverage way we found to get clients is through networking.","startTime":"11:51","endTime":"11:58","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So in person networking.","startTime":"11:58","endTime":"12:00","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And of course that's heavily dependent on both of our time.","startTime":"12:00","endTime":"12:04","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So Bill can't be building as many marketing systems and reaching out to millions of people.","startTime":"12:04","endTime":"12:08","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I can't be, you know,

work.","startTime":"12:08","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like that's something that I show up every day.","startTime":"12:22","endTime":"12:23","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Is it like desire to improve and like if we can build systems fundamentally that can scale the company without us.","startTime":"12:23","endTime":"12:31","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think that's why I feel called to take the risk to like risk something that's working and diverting our attention to something else.","startTime":"12:31","endTime":"12:40","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Particularly like if we work with you and Bill, please correct me if this doesn't feel aligned to you.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:48","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But if I work with you or we work with you, then I think I would want to instead of like trying to adapt what you're doing and like, oh, how do we take what you're doing and how do we keep it high ticket only?","startTime":"12:48","endTime":"12:57","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think I'd like to, you know, ironically follow the sense scaling heuristic of like the one source rule.","startTime":"12:58","endTime":"13:04","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So if we're working with you, if we're investing with you, then we go all in on your methodology as

okay.","startTime":"13:17","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, no.","startTime":"13:17","endTime":"13:18","speaker_name":"David

the people we already have and getting money in the door asap.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:44","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And number two is something that I just thought about while we're talking.","startTime":"21:45","endTime":"21:50","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we're gonna do a low ticket.","startTime":"21:50","endTime":"21:51","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Offer.","startTime":"21:51","endTime":"21:51","speaker_name":"Rex

true.","startTime":"22:14","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe exponential growth over time, but I see what you're

thought.","startTime":"22:22","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"22:23","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Also, are you guys in self improvement?","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, we are.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:29","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That was another one of the things is there's a chance that if we start getting noticed and we get into the school games, they might switch us over to the money category because they, I've heard that they did that to someone in the past.","startTime":"22:29","endTime":"22:41","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I don't know if you have any insight or thoughts on that, but that is something to consider.","startTime":"22:42","endTime":"22:47","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, I, yeah, I'm such.","startTime":"22:47","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You guys are not in the money

prioritize.","startTime":"23:02","endTime":"23:06","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And these other things which result in more money, result in business growth, but.","startTime":"23:06","endTime":"23:09","speaker_name":"Bill Widmer","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It'S a secondary effect.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"Rex

Owens.","startTime":"23:14","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I like send him something every day and he always responds just because, like, I feel like there needs to be more categories.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:23","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like one of my high ticket clients, she had, she's like a baker that's done

know, and like, they are working on refining discovery.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:47","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's gonna change.","startTime":"23:47","endTime":"23:49","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I feel like you guys would be good especially because, like, everything is in the

us.","startTime":"23:58","endTime":"24:08","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But you know, people go from this money to this

increased focus, like getting their time back, getting their energy back.","startTime":"24:12","endTime":"24:23","speaker_name":"Rex Loyer","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then like, oh my gosh, like
