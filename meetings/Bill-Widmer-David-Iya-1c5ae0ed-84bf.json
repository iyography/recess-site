create like a four month content library for like people to post internally, to kind of like boost.","startTime":"21:43","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, because like the main metrics that I look at is like version rank, then like monthly revenue, right?","startTime":"21:55","endTime":"22:04","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so like everything starts at conversion.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:08","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And when you have that, I create like a content library so that your members start engaging more and so your rank climbs up.","startTime":"22:08","endTime":"22:14","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then once your rank climbs up and it's

at.","startTime":"23:29","endTime":"23:31","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I create a quiz for all of my like Evolution clients too.","startTime":"23:32","endTime":"23:36","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so like the quiz gives everybody instant visibility into what everyone's doing and then kind of hacks engagement.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because now like I have a channel for people to post their quiz so I can leave.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:49","speaker_name":"David Iya","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But people are like still post like really the goal is to get the community to like run
