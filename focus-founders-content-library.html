    {c:"community",t:"Boundaries are harder with ADHD",b:"People-pleasing + RSD + hyperfocus = boundary disaster.\n\nI used to:\n• Say yes to everything\n• Work 80-hour weeks\n• Feel guilty for resting\n• Burn out spectacularly\n\nNow teaching my community:\n• No is a complete sentence\n• Rest is productive\n• Boundaries protect energy\n\nWhat boundary do you need to set?"},
    
    {c:"community",t:"Emotional contagion is real in ADHD spaces",b:"One person has a bad day.\nSuddenly everyone's spiraling.\n\nADHD brains are emotional sponges.\nWe absorb everything.\n\nLearning to:\n• Notice when I'm absorbing vs. feeling\n• Create emotional boundaries\n• Support without drowning\n\nHow do you protect your energy in emotional spaces?"},
